## Working with Data

- R is all about working with data!
- Today we're going to start going over the use of data.frames and tibbles
- data.frames are an object type; tibbles are basically data.frames with some extra bells and whistles, from the *tidyverse* package
- Most of the time, you'll be doing calculations using them

## The Basic Idea

- Conceptually, data.frames are basically spreadsheets
- Technically, they're a list of vectors

|Spreadsheet | data.frame | 
|------------|-------------|
|![](Lecture_05_Spreadsheet.png) |![](Lecture_05_data_frame.png)|


## Example

- It's a list of vectors... we can make one by listing some (same-length) vectors!
- (Note the use of = here, not <-)


```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(RacePosition = 1:5,
                 WayTheySayHi = as.factor(c('Hi','Hello','Hey','Yo','Hi')),
                 NumberofKids = c(3,5,1,0,2))
df <- tibble(RacePosition = 1:5,
                 WayTheySayHi = as.factor(c('Hi','Hello','Hey','Yo','Hi')),
                 NumberofKids = c(3,5,1,0,2))
df
```

## Looking Over Data

- Now that we have our data, how can we take a look at it?
- We can just name it in the Console and look at the whole thing, but that's usually too much data
- We can look at the whole thing by clicking on it in Environment to open it up

## Glancing at Data

- What if we just want a quick overview, rather than looking at the whole spreadsheet?
    - Down-arrow in the Environment tab
    - `head()` (look at the head of the data - first six rows)
    - `str()` (structure)
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(df)
```

## So What?

- What do we want to know about our data?
    - What is this data OF? (won't get that with `str()`)
    - Data types
    - The kinds of values it takes
    - How many observations
    - Variable names.
    - Summary statistics and observation level (we'll get to that later)

## Getting at Data

- Now we have a data frame, `df`. How do we use it?
- One way is that we can pull those vectors back out with `$`! Note autocompletion of variable names.
- We can treat it just like the vectors we had before

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df$NumberofKids
df$NumberofKids[2]
df$NumberofKids >= 3
```

## Quick Note

- There are actually many many ways to do this
- (some of which I even go over in the videos)
- For example, you can use `[row,column]` to get at data, for example `df$NumberofKids >= 3` is equivalent to `df[,3] >= 3` or `df[,'NumberofKids']>=3`

## That Said!

- We can run the same calculations on these vectors as we were doing before

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(df$RacePosition)
df$WayTheySayHi[4]
sum(df$NumberofKids <= 1)
```

## Practice

- Create `df2 <- data.frame(a = 1:20, b = 0:19*2,` `c = sample(101:200,20,replace=TRUE))`
- What is the average of `c`?
- What is the sum of `a` times `b`?
- Did you get any values of `c` 103 or below? (make a logical)
- What is on the 8th row of `b`?
- How many rows have `b` above 10 AND `c` below 150?

## Practice Answers

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
df2 <- data.frame(a = 1:20, b = 0:19*2, c = sample(101:200,20,replace=TRUE))
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mean(df2$c)
sum(df2$a*df2$b)
sum(df2$c <= 103) > 0
df2$b[8]
sum(df2$b > 10 & df2$c < 150)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mean(df2$c)
sum(df2$a*df2$b)
sum(df$c <= 103) > 0
df2$b[8]
sum(df2$b > 10 & df2$c < 150)
```

## The Importance of Rows

- So far we've basically just taken data frames and pulled the vectors (columns) back out
- So... why not just stick with the vectors?
- Because before long we're not just going to be interested in the columns one at a time
- We'll want to keep track of each *row* - each row is an observation. The same observation!

## The Importance of Rows

- Going back to `df`, that fourth row says that
    - The person in the fourth position...
    - Says hello by saying "Yo"
    - And has no kids
- We're going to want to keep that straight when we want to, say, look at the relationship between having kids and your position in the race.
- Or how the number of kids relates to how you say hello!

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
df
```

## Working With Data Frames

- Not to mention, we can manipulate data frames and tibbles!
- Let's figure out how we can:
    - Create new variables
    - Change variables
    - Rename variables
- It's very common that you'll have to work with data a little before analyzing it

## Creating New Variables

- Easy! data.frames are just lists of vectors
- So create a vector and tell R where in that list to stick it!
- Use descriptive names so you know what the variable is

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df$State <- c('Alaska','California','California','Maine','Florida')
df
```

## Our Approach - DPLYR and Tidyverse

- That's the base-R way to do it, anyway
- We're going to be using *dplyr* (think pliers) for data manipulation instead
- dplyr syntax is inspired by SQL - so learning dplyr will give you a leg up if you want to learn SQL later. Plus it's just better.

## Packages

- tidyverse isn't a part of base R. It's in a package, so we'll need to install it
- We can install packages using `install.packages('nameofpackage')`

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

- We can then check whether it's installed in the Packages tab

## Packages

- Before we can use it we must then use the `library()` command to open it up
- We'll need to run `library()` for it again every time we open up R if we want to use the package

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

- There are literally thousands of useful packages for R, and we're going to be using a few! Tidyverse will just be our first of many
- Google R package X to look for packages that do X.


## Variable creation with dplyr

- The *mutate* command will "mutate" our data frame to have a new column in it. We can then overwrite it.
- The pipe `%>%` says "take df and send it to that mutate command to use"
- Or we can stick the data frame itself in the `mutate` command

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- df %>%
  mutate(State = c('Alaska','California','California','Maine','Florida'))
df <- mutate(df,State = c('Alaska','California','California','Maine','Florida'))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(State = c('Alaska','California','California','Maine','Florida'))
```

## Creating New Variables

- We can use all the tricks we already know about creating vectors
- We can create multiple new variables in one mutate command

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- df %>% mutate(MoreThanTwoKids = NumberofKids > 2,
                    One = 1,
                    KidsPlusPosition = NumberofKids + RacePosition)
df
```

## Manipulating Variables

- We can't really *change* variables, but we sure can overwrite them!
- We can drop variables with `-` in the dplyr `select` command
- Note we chain multiple dplyr commands with `%>%`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- df %>% 
  select(-KidsPlusPosition,-WayTheySayHi,-One) %>%
  mutate(State = as.factor(State),
         RacePosition = RacePosition - 1)
df$State[3] <- 'Alaska'
str(df)
```

## Renaming Variables

- Sometimes it will make sense to change the names of the variables we have.
- Names are stored in `names(df)` which we can edit directly
- Or the `rename()` command in dplyr has us covered

```{r, echo=TRUE}
names(df)
#names(df) <- c('Pos','Num.Kids','State','mt2Kids')
df <- df %>% rename(Pos = RacePosition, Num.Kids=NumberofKids,
                    mt2Kids = MoreThanTwoKids)
names(df)
```


## tidylog

- Protip: after loading the tidyverse, also load the `tidylog` package. This will tell you what each step of your dplyr command does!

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylog)
df <- df %>% mutate(Pos = Pos + 1,
                    Num.Kids = 10)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidylog, warn.conflicts=FALSE, quietly=TRUE)
df <- df %>% mutate(Pos = Pos + 1,
                    Num.Kids = 10)
detach("package:tidylog", unload=TRUE)
```

## Practice

- Create a data set `data` with three variables: `a` is all even numbers from 2 to 20, `b` is `c(0,1)` over and over, and `c` is any ten-element numeric vector of your choice.
- Rename them to `EvenNumbers`, `Treatment`, `Outcome`.
- Add a logical variable called Big that's true whenever EvenNumbers is greater than 15
- Increase Outcome by 1 for all the rows where Treatment is 1.
- Create a logical AboveMean that is true whenever Outcome is above the mean of Outcome.
- Display the data structure

## Practice Answers

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(a = 1:10*2,
                   b = c(0,1),
                   c = sample(1:100,10,replace=FALSE)) %>%
  rename(EvenNumbers = a, Treatment = b, Outcome = c)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(Big = EvenNumbers > 15,
         Outcome = Outcome + Treatment,
         AboveMean = Outcome > mean(Outcome))
str(data)
```

## Other Ways to Get Data

- Of course, most of the time we aren't making up data
- We get it from the real world!
- Two main ways to do this are the `data()` function in R
- Or reading in files, usually with one of the `read` commands like `read.csv()`

## data()

- R has many baked-in data sets, and more in packages!
- Just type in `data(` and see what options it autocompletes
- We can load in data and look at it
- Many of these data sets have `help` files too

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data(LifeCycleSavings)
help(LifeCycleSavings)
head(LifeCycleSavings)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
data(LifeCycleSavings)
head(LifeCycleSavings)
```


## read

- Often there will be data files on the internet or your computer
- You can read this in with one of the many `read` commands, like `read.csv`
- CSV is a very basic spreadsheet format stored in a text file, you can create it from Excel or Sheets (or just write it)
- There are different `read` commands for different file types
- Make sure your working directory is set to where the data is!
- Documentation will usually be in a different file

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
datafromCSV <- read.csv('mydatafile.csv')
```

## Practice

- Use `data()` to open up a data set - any data set (although it should be in `data.frame` or `tibble` form - try again if you get something else)
- Use `str()` and `help()` to examine that data set
    - What is it data of (help file)? How was it collected and what do the variables represent?
    - What kinds of variables are in there and what kinds of values do they have (`str()` and `head()`)?
- Create a new variable using the variables that are already in there
- Take a mean of one of the variables
- Rename a variable to be more descriptive based on what you saw in `help()`.
