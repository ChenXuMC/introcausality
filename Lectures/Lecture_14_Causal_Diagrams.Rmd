## Recap

- Last time we talked about causality
- The idea that if we could reach in and manipulate `X`, and as a result `Y` changes too, then `X` *causes* `Y`
- We also talked about how we can identify causality in data
- Part of that will necessarily require us to have a model

## Models

- We *have to have a model* to get at causality
- A model is our way of *understanding the world*. It's our idea of what we think the data-generating process is
- Models can be informal or formal - "The sun rises every day because the earth spins" vs. super-complex astronomical models of the galaxy with thousands of equations
- All models are wrong. Even quantum mechanics. But as long as models are right enough to be useful, we're good to go!

##Models 

- Once we *do* have a model, though, that model will tell us *exactly* how we can find a causal effect
- (if it's possible; it's not always possible)
- Sort of like how, last time, we knew how `X` was assigned, and using that information we were able to get a good estimate of the true treatment

## Example

- Let's work through a familiar example from before, where we know the data generating process

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Is your company in tech? Let's say 30% of firms are
df <- tibble(tech = sample(c(0,1),500,replace=T,prob=c(.7,.3))) %>%
  #Tech firms on average spend $3mil more defending IP lawsuits
  mutate(IP.spend = 3*tech+runif(500,min=0,max=4)) %>%
  #Tech firms also have higher profits. But IP lawsuits lower profits
  mutate(log.profit = 2*tech - .3*IP.spend + rnorm(500,mean=2))
# Now let's check for how profit and IP.spend are correlated!
cor(df$log.profit,df$IP.spend)
```

- Uh-oh! Truth is negative relationship, but data says positive!!

## Example

- Now we can ask: *what do we know* about this situation?
- How do we suspect the data was generated? (ignoring for a moment that we know already)
    - We know that being a tech company leads you to have to spend more money on IP lawsuits
    - We know that being a tech company leads you to have higher profits
    - We know that IP lawsuits lower your profits
    
## Example

- From this, we realize that part of what we get when we calculate `cor(df$log.profit,df$IP.spend)` is the influence of being a tech company
- Meaning that if we remove that influence, what's left over should be the actual, negative, effect of IP lawsuits
- Now, we can get to this intuitively, but it would be much more useful if we had a more formal model that could tell us what to do in *lots* of situations

## Causal Diagrams

- Enter the causal diagram!
- A causal diagram (aka a Directed Acyclic Graph) is a way of writing down your *model* that lets you figure out what you need to do to find your causal effect of interest
- All you need to do to make a causal diagram is write down all the important features of the data generating process, and also write down what you think causes what!

## Example

- We know that being a tech company leads you to have to spend more money on IP lawsuits
- We know that being a tech company leads you to have higher profits
- We know that IP lawsuits lower your profits

## Example

- <span style="color:red">We know that being a tech company leads you to have to spend more money on IP lawsuits</span>
- We know that being a tech company leads you to have higher profits
- We know that IP lawsuits lower your profits

```{r CairoPlot, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
dag <- dagify(IP.sp~tech) %>% tidy_dagitty()
ggdag(dag,node_size=20)
```

## Example

- <span style="color:red">We know that being a tech company leads you to have to spend more money on IP lawsuits</span>
- <span style="color:red">We know that being a tech company leads you to have higher profits</span>
- We know that IP lawsuits lower your profits

```{r, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
dag <- dagify(IP.sp~tech,
              profit~tech) %>% tidy_dagitty()
ggdag(dag,node_size=20)
```

## Example

- <span style="color:red">We know that being a tech company leads you to have to spend more money on IP lawsuits</span>
- <span style="color:red">We know that being a tech company leads you to have higher profits</span>
- <span style="color:red">We know that IP lawsuits lower your profits</span>

```{r, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
dag <- dagify(IP.sp~tech,
              profit~tech+IP.sp) %>% tidy_dagitty()
ggdag(dag,node_size=20)
```

## Viola

- We have *encoded* everything we know about this particular little world in our diagram
- (well, not everything, the diagram doesn't say whether we think these effects are positive or negative)
- Not only can we see our assumptions, but we can see how they fit together
- For example, if we were looking for the impact of *tech* on profit, we'd know that it happens directly, AND happens because tech affects `IP.spend`, which then affects profit.

## Identification

- And if we want to isolate the effect of `IP.spend` on `profit`, we can figure that out too
- We call this process - isolating just the causal effect we're interested in - "identification"
- We're *identifying* just one of those arrows, the one `IP.spend -> profit`, and seeing what the effect is on that arrow!

## Identification

- Based on this graph, we can see that part of the correlation between `IP.Spend` and `profit` can be *explained by* how `tech` links the two.

```{r, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
dag <- dagify(IP.sp~tech,
              profit~tech+IP.sp) %>% tidy_dagitty()
ggdag(dag,node_size=20)
```

## Identification

- Since we can *explain* part of the correlation with `tech`, but we want to *identify* the part of the correlation that ISN'T explained by `tech` (the causal part), we will want to just use what isn't explained by tech!
    - Use `tech` to explain `profit`, and take the residual
    - Use `tech` to explain `IP.spend`, and take the residual
    - The relationship between the first residual and the second residual is *causal*!

## Controlling

- This process is called "adjusting" or "controlling". We are "controlling for tech" and taking out the part of the relationship that is explained by it
- In doing so, we're looking at the relationship between `IP.spend` and `profit` *just comparing firms that have the same level of `tech`*. 
- This is our "apples to apples" comparison that gives us an experiment-like result

## Controlling

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df <- df %>% group_by(tech) %>%
  mutate(log.profit.resid = log.profit - mean(log.profit),
         IP.spend.resid = IP.spend - mean(IP.spend)) %>% ungroup()
cor(df$log.profit.resid,df$IP.spend.resid)
```

- Negative! Hooray

## Controlling

- Imagine we're looking at that relationship *within color*

```{r, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE,fig.height=5.5,fig.width=8}
ggplot(mutate(df,tech=factor(tech,labels=c("Not Tech","Tech"))),
              aes(x=IP.spend,y=log.profit,color=tech))+geom_point()+  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Firm Type"))+
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## LITERALLY

```{r, dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE,fig.height=5.5,fig.width=5.5}
df <- df %>% 
  group_by(tech) %>%
  mutate(mean_profit = mean(log.profit),
         mean_IP = mean(IP.spend)) %>% ungroup()

before_cor <- paste("1. Raw data. Correlation between log.profit and IP.spend: ",round(cor(df$log.profit,df$IP.spend),3),sep='')
after_cor <- paste("6. Analyze what's left! cor(log.profit,IP.spend) controlling for tech: ",round(cor(df$log.profit-df$mean_profit,df$IP.spend-df$mean_IP),3),sep='')




#Add step 2 in which IP.spend is demeaned, and 3 in which both IP.spend and log.profit are, and 4 which just changes label
dffull <- rbind(
  #Step 1: Raw data only
  df %>% mutate(mean_IP=NA,mean_profit=NA,time=before_cor),
  #Step 2: Add x-lines
  df %>% mutate(mean_profit=NA,time='2. Figure out what differences in IP.spend are explained by tech'),
  #Step 3: IP.spend de-meaned 
  df %>% mutate(IP.spend = IP.spend - mean_IP,mean_IP=0,mean_profit=NA,time="3. Remove differences in IP.spend explained by tech"),
  #Step 4: Remove IP.spend lines, add log.profit
  df %>% mutate(IP.spend = IP.spend - mean_IP,mean_IP=NA,time="4. Figure out what differences in log.profit are explained by tech"),
  #Step 5: log.profit de-meaned
  df %>% mutate(IP.spend = IP.spend - mean_IP,log.profit = log.profit - mean_profit,mean_IP=NA,mean_profit=0,time="5. Remove differences in log.profit explained by tech"),
  #Step 6: Raw demeaned data only
  df %>% mutate(IP.spend = IP.spend - mean_IP,log.profit = log.profit - mean_profit,mean_IP=NA,mean_profit=NA,time=after_cor))

p <- ggplot(dffull,aes(y=log.profit,x=IP.spend,color=as.factor(tech)))+geom_point()+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean_IP,color=as.factor(tech)))+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mean_profit,color=as.factor(tech)))+
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="tech"))+
  scale_color_colorblind()+
  labs(title = 'The Relationship between log.profit and IP.spend, Controlling for tech \n{next_state}')+

```

## Recap

- By controlling for `tech` ("holding it constant") we got rid of the part of the `IP.spend`/`profit` relationship that was explained by `tech`, and so managed to *identify* the `IP.spend -> profit` arrow, the causal effect we're interested in!
- We correctly found that it was negative
- Remember, we made it truly negative when we created the data, all those slides ago

## Causal Diagrams

- And it was the diagram that told us to control for `tech`
- It's going to turn out that diagrams can tell us how to identify things in much more complex circumstances - we'll get to that soon
- But you might have noticed that it was pretty obvious what to do just by looking at the graph

## Causal Diagrams

- Can't we just look at the data to see what we need to control for?
- After all, that would free us from having to make all those assumptions and figure out our model
- No!!!
- Why? Because for a given set of data that we see, there are *many* different data generating processes that could have made it
- Each requiring different kinds of adjustments in order to get it right

## Causal Diagrams

- We observe that `profit` (y), `IP.spend` (x), and `tech` (z) are all related... which is it?

```{r dev='CairoPNG', echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggdag_equivalent_dags(confounder_triangle(x_y_associated=TRUE),node_size=12)
```

## Causal Diagrams

- With only the data to work with we have *literally no way of knowing* which of those is true
- Maybe `IP.spend` causes companies to be `tech` companies (in 2, 3, 6)
- We know that's silly because we have an idea of what the model is
- But that's what lets us know it's wrong - the model. With just the data we have no clue.

## Causal Diagrams

- Next time we'll set about actually making one of these diagrams
- And soon we'll be looking for what the diagrams tell us about how to identify an effect!

## Practice

- Load in `data(swiss)` and use `help` to look at it
- Get the correlation between Fertility and Education
- Think about what direction the arrows might go on a diagram with Fertility, Education, and Agriculture
- Get the corrlelation between Fertility and Education *controlling for Agriculture* (use `cut` with `breaks=3`)

## Practice Answers

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data(swiss)
help(swiss)
cor(swiss$Fertility,swiss$Education)

swiss <- swiss %>%
  group_by(cut(Agriculture,breaks=3)) %>%
  mutate(Fert.resid = Fertility - mean(Fertility),
         Ed.resid = Education - mean(Education))

cor(swiss$Fert.resid,swiss$Ed.resid)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
data(swiss)
cor(swiss$Fertility,swiss$Education)

swiss <- swiss %>%
  group_by(cut(Agriculture,breaks=3)) %>%
  mutate(Fert.resid = Fertility - mean(Fertility),
         Ed.resid = Education - mean(Education))

cor(swiss$Fert.resid,swiss$Ed.resid)
```
